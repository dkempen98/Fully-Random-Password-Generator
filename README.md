# Password Generator

Link to the tool: https://dkempen98.github.io/Fully-Random-Password-Generator/

## Description

PRIMARY GOAL: Generate passwords that follow set criteria
    
WHAT HAPPENS:

- Button getting pushed starts a series of prompts to fill in desired criteria

- Able to select the different options for the criteria

- Criteria that can be selected:

    - Password length (anywhere from 8-128 characters)
    
    - Case requirements (Upper, lower or none)
    
    - Number requirements (Yes / No)
    
    - Special characters (Yes / No)
    
    - Need at least one character type to be selected
    
- Answers are validated as you move through

- Once criteria has been entered, password is generated matching the criteria

- Password is displayed on screen

## USAGE

This can be used to generate fully random passwords of set lengths. The optional criteria allows you to keep them simpler if you want to and it also makes it work for all standard password requirements you may run into on different websites. There is no database connected to this tool so the passwords you generate are not stored anywhere when you make them.

This project is complete and has passed all of my personal testing. It is also mobile friendly!

## SOURCES

All but a few lines of the javascript were written by me for the rest of the project
